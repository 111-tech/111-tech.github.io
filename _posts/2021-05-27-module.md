# 문제 상황
1. 모듈 statistic.py를 임포트하여 결과와 같이 출력되도록 프로그램을 작성해 봅시다.

[결과]
mylist=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
합계: 465
평균: 15.5
최댓값: 30
최솟값: 1

[statistics.py]
def mysum(lst):
s=0
for i in lst:
s+=i return s

def mymean(lst):
everage=sum(lst)/len(lst)
return everage

def mymin(lst):
mn=lst[0]
for i in lst:
if mn>i:
mn=i return mn
def mymax(lst):
mx=lst[0]
for i in lst:
if mx<i:
mx=i return mx


# 문제 해결 프로그래밍
~~~python
from statistic import mysum
from statistic import mymean
from statistic import mymin
from statistic import mymax

mylist=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]

print('mylist =', mylist)
print('합계:', mysum(mylist))
print('평균:', mymean(mylist))
print('최댓값:', mymax(mylist))
print('최솟값:', mymin(mylist))
~~~
